UltimateScoreboards is a powerful and light plugin to manage scoreboards on your Minecraft server.  
It comes with a ton of features which allows you to easily customize your scoreboards. 

UltimateScoreboard is :
* **fast**: the plugin is written with efficiency in mind
* **easy to use**: the plugin is pretty straightforward to use
* **flexible**: every other team-based plugin out there is supported (obviously, not scoreboard ones) 
* **extensive**: you can customize everything from the config
* **built-in antiflicker**: scoreboards will never flick
* **packet-based**: the plugin is all packet-based, which means that it won't impact on the server performance
* **the best one**: you can create scoreboards on 1.8-1.12 with ~70 characters per line with only 1-tick update delay (no other plugin that I'm aware of can do that).
