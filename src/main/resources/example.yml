# Types:
# LONG - Supports 60-72 characters per line (72 without color codes).
# LITE - Supports 24-32 characters per line (32 without color codes).
# STATIC - Supports 60-72 characters per line (72 without color codes), but doesn't supports animations.
# v1_13 - Supports infinite characters per line, but is available only on 1.13+ servers.
scoreboard-type: LONG

# How many ticks should scoreboard update animations and placeholders (1 sec = 20 ticks). It must be at least 1 and an integer.
# If scoreboard-type is set to LONG, due to internal implementation, the scoreboard takes 3 updates to show the new values.
# To fix this, set this to (how many ticks it should update) / 3.
# N.B.: Ignored if scoreboard-type is STATIC, since there aren't updates.
update-frequency: 10

# Whether scoreboard contains per-player options (like some placeholders).
# If scoreboard doesn't contains per-player things (ex: static lines or bungeecord placeholder) set this to false, otherwise set this to true.
# This setting is used for internal optimizations and to reduce used memory.
# N.B.: Ignored if scoreboard-type is STATIC.
per-player-scoreboard: false

# If scoreboard-type is LONG or STATIC, it could happen that two or more lines bug if they're contains equals substrings.
# Turn this to true if you experience bugs with lines.
# This setting is set to false by defualt, since it reduce max characters per line by either 2 or 4 characters.
# N.B.: Ignored if scoreboard-type is LITE or v1_13.
